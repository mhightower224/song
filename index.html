        Justin Vernon(Writer) from Apple Music: “Just some ‘life feels good now, don’t it?‘ There’s a lot to be sad about, there’s a lot to be confused about, there’s a lot to be thankful for. And leaning on gratitude and appreciation of the people around you that make you who you are, make you feel safe, and provide that shelter so you can be who you want to be, there’s still that impetus in life. We need that. It’s a nice way to close the record, we all thought.”<cite>Bon Iver</cite></p>

          <p>Well, it's all just scared of dying</p>
          <p>But isn't this a beach?</p>
          <p>And if I know one thing at all</p>
          <p>Is I cannot just be a peach</p>
          <p>Oh, you come in all woke now</p>
          <p>So, please enjoy the feast</p>
          <p>We are weightless like a wayless beast</p>
          <p>So what is it we don't teach?</p>

          <p>When we were children we were hell-bent</p>
          <p>Or oblivious at least</p>
          <p>But now it comes to mind</p>
          <p>We are terrified</p>
          <p>So we run and hide</p>
          <p>For a verified little peace</p>

          <p>Sun light feels good now, don't it?</p>
          <p>And I don't have a leaving plan</p>
          <p>But something's gotta ease your mind</p>
          <p>But it's all fine, or it's all crime anyway</p>

          <p>There were six of us sitting creek side</p>
          <p>Sifting fistfuls through the green</p>
          <p>Every which way could be seen</p>
          <p>Was the sand and time</p>
          <p>Not a pantomime</p>
          <p>More like anodyne</p>
          <p>Was a friend of mine</p>

          <p>I could rob I, however</p>
          <p>Everywhere isn’t everywhere</p>
          <p>This is not a veil</p>
